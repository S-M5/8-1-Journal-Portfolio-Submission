#Q:Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
#Q: What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
#Q: Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
#Q: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
#Q: How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
#Q: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
#Q: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

#A: Artimis Financial is an investment brokerage firm that focuses on the financial growth of their consumers, as a result they required a software that would 
be flexible for development and secure private information for their clientel while providing a remote access window for their clientel to see their investments
and make appropriate remote changes that would provide flexible and swift investing. When i found my clients vulnerabilities i was able to effectivly and timely 
find their fixes to effectively correct them, providing that its necessary to code securely to ensure passive script comprehension and flexible change history with 
proper citation and comments, this and software security adds to a company's overall wellbeing via effective and retroactive security procedures for effective 
minimization of data mishandeling and corruption. Maven was spectacularly helpful as it allowed for software to effectively be identified for vulnerabilities
leaving manual vulnerabilities involving poor scripting as the priority focus. Updating software is a start but also increasing security via encryption ensured
secured data, honestly i would use all presented to me to assess vulnerabilites from testers to peers to prototyping. Due to certain personal issues i was unable
to make the final in project two functional but was able to minimize introducing or even removing vulnerabilites by refactoring certain segments. Since this was
a complete learning experience i would be using everything from this class to help in my future endeavors. That i was persistent enough to try again.
